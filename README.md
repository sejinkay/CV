<br>

Software developer with a background in creative industries.

I believe good story brings good design.
The same goes for the code, I'd like to code to create great memories for users.

Working in various design fields has taught me both how to work in a team and solo - collaborating with people from different disciplines such as actors/writers and managing for tight deadlines. I'm a curious learner who can quickly adapt to a new work environment.

I've worked in Ruby, Javascript, C# (Unity engine) and HTML/CSS. Also I've been teaching myself Python with a personal interest in Machine Learning.

## SKILLS

#### Team worker
During my study at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), we often worked in teams of 4 to 6. Good communication was one of the key aspects of working together.
I love giving and receiving feedback, helping both my team members and me to grow as better programmers.
Another important aspect is time management, I like breaking the tasks into achievable pieces based on priorities and approaching them in the Agile way.


Some examples of my team's work processes can be found at [Guac-a-mole Wiki](https://github.com/guilhe0756/guac-a-mole/wiki) or [Acebook Wiki](https://github.com/tsankhalpara/acebook-MVP/wiki)

#### Flexible Learner

I enjoy Learning outside of my comfort zone. While working in various design fields, I had to learn different programs that were required for each position - Video/sound editing tools, animation makers etc. Before joining the Makers Academy, I could't tell you the difference between Java and Javascript (Yes, I was one of those people). Through the 4 months of intensive study, I've learnt to teach myself better in limited timeframes -  I've covered several different programming languages & frameworks (you can check them at [PROJECTS](#PROJECTS)). I even created a virtual thermostat using a weather API in Javascript [here](https://github.com/sejinkay/Thermostat).

#### Problem-Solver

My experience of working as a Quality Assurance Technician enabled me to gain a keen eye on finding/fixing bugs. I take a methodical approach, step by step to tighten the loop. One piece of the peer feedback I received after working on the [MakersBnB](https://github.com/sejinkay/MakersBnB) project was - 'Sejin saved the day a few times, spotting errors that no one else had caught.' This is the goal I'm hoping to achieve every day.
